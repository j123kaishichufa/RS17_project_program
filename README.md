# RS17_project_program
processing programs for RS17 , including python script, perl script, java program, or jar

## 1) icws2017/

reproduce MEM methods. It includes: 

produce basic statatis data;

parse semantic information from text of code base; 

compute semantic similarity between classes;

partition graph using mst;

extract provided and required interface.

## 2) legacy/   

legacy code, ignore it.

## 3) split/    

methods of FoME. It includes:

analyze monitoring log to generate execution traces and workflow;

reduce execution data, and delete redudancy;

visualize execution data in tree format;

Parse communication dependency of exectution trace;

clustering of execution traces based on execution;

analyze shared classes between services;

process shared classes using two strategies;

choose best parameter by using pareto analysis, fast non-dominant sort.

extract provided and required interfaces of services.

implement a search-based methods (NSGA-II) to optimize service extraction. (multi-object optimization).

Computed interService calling, and basic measures.


## 4) testCaseCluster

legacy code, ignore it.

## 5) tradititional_clustering/

wca and limbo methods. It includes:

Parse structural dependency from udb generated by SCITtool understand.

extract provided and required interfaces of services.

Computed interService calling, and basic measures.

## 6) measure/

evaluation by using interface-level metrics and co-change history. It includes:

measure domain-level cohesion;

measure message-level cohesion;

measure class-class co-evolution frequency by evolution history;

measure interface size;

[Notice: interService calling is computed in directory of respective methods.]

## 7) improvesplit/

use the updated NSGAII algorithm to group funtional atoms into different candidates.
